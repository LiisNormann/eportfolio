I almost never spend my days just sitting in front of the tv. I absolutely love to cook, especially with the addition of friends/family and card games. I have also been a volunteer at a student exchange program since 2014, which involves a lot of teamwork and teambuilding. Sometimes I pretend to be an artist by spending my late evening hours engaged in ‘paint-by-number’ or self-learning the piano. Lastly, I love nature and traveling and I cannot wait to see the beautiful places and challenges the world has to offer for me, both inside and outside of my role as a future software developer!
