Hello there! My name is Liis and I am a 26-year-old student at Tartu Vocational Education Center. After spending four years in the Netherlands to obtain a Bachelor degree in Psychology, I finally realised that social sciences is not quite where I belong. Instead I discovered my deep interest and passion in software development, leading me to study exactly that! I guess my mum had a point when she said: ‘In a family of IT nerds, it was only a matter of time before you followed the same path!’
