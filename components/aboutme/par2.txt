As a person, not only do I have a very outgoing and bubbly personality, but I also see myself as a hard working individual who is never the one to pack down from a challenge. I am always determined to finish what I started and give my absolute best while doing so. I am not scared to ask for help as well as provide help, such as tutoring statistics back at university.
