Hello there! My name is Liis and I am a 27-year-old student at Tartu Vocational Education Center. After spending four years in the Netherlands to obtain a Bachelor degree in Psychology, I finally realised that social sciences is not quite where I belong. Instead I discovered my deep interest and passion in software development, leading me to study exactly that! I guess my mum had a point when she said: ‘In a family of IT nerds, it was only a matter of time before you followed the same path!’ ||
As a person, not only do I have a very outgoing and bubbly personality, but I also see myself as a hard working individual who is never the one to back down from a challenge. I am always determined to finish what I started and give my absolute best while doing so. I am not scared to ask for help as well as provide help, such as tutoring statistics back at university.||
I almost never spend my days just sitting in front of the tv. I absolutely love to cook, especially with the addition of friends/family and card games. I have also been a volunteer at a student exchange program since 2014, which involves a lot of teamwork and teambuilding. Sometimes I pretend to be an artist by spending my late evening hours engaged in ‘paint-by-number’ or self-learning the piano. Lastly, I love nature and traveling and I cannot wait to see the beautiful places and challenges the world has to offer for me, both inside and outside of my role as a future software developer! ||
Unfortunately I am yet to create something of my own as a software developer but I am more than excited to express myself in future projects and hopefully even competitions.
